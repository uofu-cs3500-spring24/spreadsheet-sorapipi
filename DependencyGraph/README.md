# Comments to Evaluators:
This project is used to evaluate arithmetic expressions using standard infix notation. when we have a expression something like a combination between variable, integer and operators.
we need to split the expression into some tokens, then just loop over these tokens. according to the token's type( variable, integer, parenthesis, operators) we need to decide which way we need use to process them.
And at the end we need to get the evaluated result of the expression
